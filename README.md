# No Guts
A C# (CSharp) Console App project. My biggest and most challenging project so far. It is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" type of game. My final examination project, for my skills to be evaluated by my trainers. Using this project I was examinated by my trainers from Lutz & Grub Academy, to decide if I should learn Application Development or System Integration. The trainers were happy with my work, so I went with Application Development. ^^

*In "AbschlussprojektAuftrag.pdf" are the instructions for the project, and in "Feedback.docx" is the feedback I received from the trainers.*

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "No Guts.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
