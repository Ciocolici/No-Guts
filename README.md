# No Guts

A C# (CSharp) Console App project. My biggest and most challenging project so far. It is a "Choose Your Own Adventure"-style game, written as my final exam project at Lutz + Grub Academy to determine if I should specialize in Application Development or System Integration. I chose Application Development.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "No Guts.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
